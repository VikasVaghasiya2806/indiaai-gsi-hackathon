This repository contains the full implementation of a multi-label deep learning pipeline designed for mineral prospectivity mapping using stream sediment geochemical data. Our work leverages big data analytics, attention-based neural networks, and explainable AI (XAI) to identify potential mineral zones for critical elements such as Cu, Ni, Co, Au, and Pt.
